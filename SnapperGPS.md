## SnapperGPS (in development)
![SnapperGPS](./images/snappergps.png)

[SnapperGPS](https://twitter.com/SnapperGPS) is an archival location tracking system that I co-developed as part of my PhD. It comprises a small, low-cost, low-power data logger and a [web application](https://snappergps.info/) that is used to configure the device and handles the post-processing of the data. SnapperGPS achieves real-world accuracies of 10m - 20m and can run for over ten years on a coin cell. Despite its name, SnapperGPS actually uses multiple global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), not just GPS. It also uses Galileo and BeiDou. <br>

You can read more about the system in this [open access paper in the Journal of Open Hardware](https://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.48).<br>

SnapperGPS has been successfully deployed on multiple species, including sea turtles and birds. You can read about the first sea turtle deployment in [this ISTS40 conference abstract](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c9acf083-d5e5-4265-8425-67509c5e3b9b/files/sgx41mj82p) or [this GitHub conversation](https://github.com/orgs/SnapperGPS/discussions/4). <br>

Follow the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SnapperGPS) for updates. We are hoping to make a version available for purchase soon, however, global chip shortages have been making this difficult. It's all open-source, though, so you can always build your own if you can find the components :) <br><br>
