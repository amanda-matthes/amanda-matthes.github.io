## about me

I am an engineer at [Amodo Design](https://www.amododesign.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I have a PhD in computer science from the University of Oxford with the CDT in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems ([AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}) and an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Heidelberg.

Generally, I am interested in any work that could have a large positive impact on humans or other animals. Currently, I think a lot about how to develop better tools (hardware and software) for ecology research. I would be especially excited to support work that aims to better understand (or maybe even improve) the welfare of wild animals.

<!-- My most recent project involved co-developing [SnapperGPS](https://twitter.com/SnapperGPS){:target="_blank"}, an open-source, low-cost, low-power GNSS location data logging system, specifically developed for tracking wild animals. My supervisor is [Prof Alex Rogers](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alex.rogers/){:target="_blank"}. -->

<!-- I want to use my career to improve wellbeing now and in the future. I think that I can currently have the highest impact by researching potential new cause areas and effective interventions. I am also interested in developing potentially high-impact technologies (hardware and software). -->

<!-- Apart from my PhD work, I am currently trying to understand if ecosystem collapse is a neglected existential risk. We currently have no technology to replace key ecosystem services, such as providing breathable air, safe water and pollination. It seems unclear how likely catastrophic ecosystem collapse is, although accelerating biodiversity loss is an alarming indicator that this risk is increasing rapidly. <br> -->

<!-- Another recent side interest of mine is how improving supply chains (particularly through local and distributed manufacturing) can drastically reduce the costs of humanitarian aid work. <br><br> -->
