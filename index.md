## About
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford with the [AIMS CDT](aims.robots.ox.ac.uk). I have an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Heidelberg, where I wrote my thesis on superscalar out-of-order processors. <br>

## BSc Thesis - Exploiting Instruction Level Parallelism
Superscalar out-of-order execution has become the norm in modern processors. Yet there is little information in the literature about its implementation details. This thesis explores what new hardware structures superscalar out-of-order execution requires. It presents a design for a simple processor, implemented in SystemVerilog, that uses register renaming, reservation stations and a reorder buffer to dynamically schedule instructions. <br>

You can access the whole thesis text [here](https://github.com/amanda-matthes/amanda-matthes.github.io/blob/master/docs/bachelor.pdf). <br>

## Oxford University Physics Society
The [OU Physics Society](https://oxford-physsoc.com/) organises talks, extracurricular classes and socials for anyone interested physics and its many applications. I am currently the Publicity Officer and in charge of the event announcements and any new stash. <br>
Stay up to date on our events with our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/physsoc) or join our mailing list on our [website](https://oxford-physsoc.com/) to become a physics phriend! <br> <br>
This September we are also co-hosting the inaugural [Varsity Sci](https://www.facebook.com/events/356998161964217)! This is a virtual five-day symposium where Oxbridge researchers can present their work in 10-20 minute talks. If you are interested in giving a talk about your research use [this form](https://tinyurl.com/varsitysci).

## Lecture Notes
Most of my lecture notes are not worth sharing but here are some that might help others taking these courses now (or similar ones).
I usually type out my lecture notes whenever the lecturer does not provide them or if the official notes are not useful. For me, lecture notes need to be searchable (so not handwritten), written in full sentences (so slides don't count) and concise but comprehensive. <br>
Sometimes I just like to type out lecture notes as a form of revision for the exam. <br>

#### English notes:

##### [Introduction to Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://github.com/amanda-matthes/amanda-matthes.github.io/blob/master/docs/Introduction_to_Astrophysics_and_Cosmology.pdf)
Held in the winter of 2017/2018 at the University of Manchester by Prof Gary Fuller and Prof Albert Zijlstra. This course is an introduction to stars, orbits, galaxies and cosmology.<br>

##### [Quantum Physics and Relativity](https://github.com/amanda-matthes/amanda-matthes.github.io/blob/master/docs/Quantum_Physics_and_Relativity.pdf)
Held in the winter of 2017/2018 at the University of Manchester by Prof Brian Cox and Prof Jeffrey Forshaw. It is a very simple introduction to SRT and Quantum Physics.<br>

##### [Applications of Quantum Physics](https://github.com/amanda-matthes/amanda-matthes.github.io/blob/master/docs/Applications_of_Quantum_Physics.pdf)
Held in the winter of 2017/2018 at the University of Manchester by Prof Sean Freeman. The course introduces some interesting new technologies in which quantum phenomena like tunneling and superposition are exploited. This is mostly just a typed out copy of the handwritten lecture notes with some comments by me.<br>

##### [Zeeman Spectroscopy](https://github.com/amanda-matthes/amanda-matthes.github.io/blob/master/docs/f44.pdf)
This is a long evaluation for one of the many experiments that physics students at the University of Heidelberg have to do to get their BSc degree.<br>

#### German notes:

##### [Experimentalphysik IV](https://github.com/amanda-matthes/amanda-matthes.github.io/blob/master/docs/Experimentalphysik_IV.pdf)
Held in the summer of 2017 at the University of Heidelberg by Prof Johanna Stachel. Experimental physics IV is a course on nuclear and particle physics. <br>
