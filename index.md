## About

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford with the [AIMS CDT](aims.robots.ox.ac.uk). I have an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Heidelberg, where I wrote my thesis on superscalar out-of-order processors. <br>
I hope to eventually pursue research into quantum computers, but I am also interested in optimising classical computer architectures and developing video games. <br>

## BSc Thesis - Exploiting Instruction Level Parallelism

Superscalar out-of-order execution has become the norm in modern processors. Yet there is little information in the literature about its implementation details. This thesis explores what new hardware structures superscalar out-of-order execution requires. It presents a design for a simple processor, implemented in SystemVerilog, that uses register renaming, reservation stations and a reorder buffer to dynamically schedule instructions. <br>
