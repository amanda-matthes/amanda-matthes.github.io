## About

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford with the AIMS CDT (aims.robots.ox.ac.uk). I have an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Heidelberg, where I wrote my thesis on superscalar out-of-order processors. <br>
I hope to eventually pursue research into quantum computers, but I am also interested in optimising classical computer architectures and developing video games. <br>
