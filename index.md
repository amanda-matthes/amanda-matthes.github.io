## About

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford with the [AIMS CDT](aims.robots.ox.ac.uk). I have an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Heidelberg, where I wrote my thesis on superscalar out-of-order processors. <br>
I hope to eventually pursue research into quantum computers, but I am also interested in optimising classical computer architectures and developing video games. <br>

## BSc Thesis - Exploiting Instruction Level Parallelism

Superscalar out-of-order execution has become the norm in modern processors. Yet there is little information in the literature about its implementation details. This thesis explores what new hardware structures superscalar out-of-order execution requires. It presents a design for a simple processor, implemented in SystemVerilog, that uses register renaming, reservation stations and a reorder buffer to dynamically schedule instructions. <br>

### A Simple Logic Circuit Simulator 

A simple console-based simulator for idealised logic circuits. You can find a compiled .exe in the folder "Debug". <br>

### Lecture Notes
Most of my lecture notes are not worth sharing but here are some that might help others taking these courses now (or similar ones).
I usually type out my lecture notes whenever the lecturer does not provide them or if the official notes are not useful. For me, lecture notes need to be searchable (so not handwritten), written in full sentences (so slides don't count) and concise but comprehensive. <br>
Sometimes I just like to type out lecture notes as a form of revision for the exam. <br>

#### English notes:

##### Introduction to Astrophysics and Cosmology
Held in the winter of 2017/2018 at the University of Manchester by Prof Gary Fuller and Prof Albert Zijlstra. This course is an introduction to stars, orbits, galaxies and cosmology.<br>

##### Quantum Physics and Relativity
Held in the winter of 2017/2018 at the University of Manchester by Prof Brian Cox and Prof Jeffrey Forshaw. It is a very simple introduction to SRT and Quantum Physics.<br>

##### Applications of Quantum Physics
Held in the winter of 2017/2018 at the University of Manchester by Prof Sean Freeman. The course introduces some interesting new technologies in which quantum phenomena like tunneling and superposition are exploited. This is mostly just a typed out copy of the handwritten lecture notes with some comments by me.<br>

##### Zeeman Spectroscopy
This is a long evaluation for one of the many experiments that physics students at the University of Heidelberg have to do to get their BSc degree.<br>

#### German notes:

##### Experimentalphysik IV
Held in the summer of 2017 at the University of Heidelberg by Prof Johanna Stachel. Experimental physics IV is a course on nuclear and particle physics. <br>
