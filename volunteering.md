## volunteering and society involvement

<!-- ### Oxford University Powerlifting Club
I am currently the Novice Captain for the [Oxford University Powerlifting Club](https://www.ouplc.co.uk/). If you are interested in getting started with lifting heavy weights, get in touch! <br>
When gyms closed, most of us couldn't train the way we wanted to. To make it through all those months, I started a weekly movie night for fellow lifters to hang out and watch silly strength sport related movies. Send me a message if you would like an invite to the WhatsApp group. <br>

### Oxford University Physics Society
The [Oxford University Physics Society](https://oxford-physsoc.com/) organises talks, extracurricular classes and socials for anyone interested physics and its many applications. I am now the society's Media Officer after being the Publicity Officer for a year. You might know me as the occasional host of our Wednesday talks during the pandemic. <br>
Stay up to date on our events with our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/physsoc) or join our mailing list on our [website](https://oxford-physsoc.com/) to become a physics phriend! I also launched our [online store](https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/ou-physics-society-stash/all) for all your stash needs. <br> -->
